# Guided Project: ThinkRx Randomized Controlled Trial (Beta)

In this project, you will reproduce aspects of the research conducted in the following research paper:

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This guided project will utilize a modified version of the original data from this research, which was made available to the public domain through the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) repository.

There are 3 exercises in this guided project:

1.  Preparing the Data
2.  Validating Random Assignment of Groups
3.  Evaluating Equivalence of Testing Results Between Groups

Exercises are located in the *exercises* folder, and the solutions are located in the *solutions* folder.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have both R and RStudio installed. In addition, you should be familiar with the knowledge covered in:

-   R for Everyone
-   R for Data Manipulation

## Getting Started

Before you begin, we recommend review the research paper to familiarize yourself with the experiment setup.

1.  Download the entire *dsi_guided_projects* directory as a zip file from GitHub.
2.  Open the *thinkrx.Rproj* file (located in the *thinkrx* folder) in RStudio.
3.  Make sure the `renv` package is installed, and run `renv:restore()` in the RStudio Console.
4.  Open one of the R markdown notebooks in the *exercises* folder and follow the instructions there to begin the exercise. We recommend viewing the R Markdown notebooks in [visual mode](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/).
5.  Once you complete an exercise, you can view its solution by opening the R markdown notebook in the *solutions* folder.
