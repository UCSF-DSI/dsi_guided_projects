This guided project will utilize a modified version of the original data from this research, which was made available to the public domain through the [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/) repository.

There are 2 exercises in this guided project:

1.  Summarize Demographics
2.  Complete ANOVA Test

Exercises are located in the *exercises* folder, and the solutions are located in the *solutions* folder.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have both R and RStudio installed. In addition, you should be familiar with the knowledge covered in:

-   R for Everyone
-   R for Data Manipulation

## Getting Started

Before you begin, we recommend review the research paper to familiarize yourself with the experiment setup.

1.  Download the entire *dsi_guided_projects* directory as a zip file from GitHub.
2.  Open the *bata.Rproj* file (located in the *bata* folder) in RStudio.
3.  Make sure the `tidyverse` package is installed.
4.  Open one of the R markdown notebooks in the *exercises* folder and follow the instructions there to begin the exercise. We recommend viewing the R Markdown notebooks in [visual mode](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/).
5.  Once you complete an exercise, you can view its solution by opening the R markdown notebook in the *solutions* folder.
